# Worker Dashboard - Task & Profile Management System

## Overview

This is a full-stack web application built as a Worker Dashboard for managing tasks and browser profiles. The application fetches tasks from an external Task Center API and allows users to create and manage browser profiles locally. It features a clean, modern interface with real-time data management capabilities.

## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture
- **Framework**: React 18 with TypeScript
- **Build Tool**: Vite for fast development and optimized builds
- **Routing**: Wouter for lightweight client-side routing
- **State Management**: TanStack Query (React Query) for server state management
- **UI Framework**: Shadcn/ui components built on Radix UI primitives
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with custom design tokens
- **Form Management**: React Hook Form with Zod validation

### Backend Architecture
- **Runtime**: Node.js with Express.js
- **Language**: TypeScript with ES modules
- **Database ORM**: Drizzle ORM with PostgreSQL dialect
- **Database Provider**: Neon Database (serverless PostgreSQL)
- **API Design**: RESTful API with structured error handling
- **Development**: Hot reload with tsx for TypeScript execution

### Key Components

#### Database Schema
- **Tasks Table**: Stores tasks fetched from external Task Center API
  - Fields: id, title, description, status, priority, assignee, source, timestamps
  - Status values: pending, in_progress, completed
  - Priority levels: low, medium, high

- **Profiles Table**: Stores locally managed browser configurations
  - Fields: id, name, browser, userAgent, proxy settings, cookie preferences, status, timestamps
  - Browser types: chrome, firefox, edge, safari
  - Proxy types: none, http, https, socks5

#### API Endpoints
- `GET /api/tasks` - List all tasks
- `GET /api/tasks/:id` - Get specific task
- `POST /api/tasks/fetch-from-task-center` - Fetch tasks from external API
- `PUT /api/tasks/:id` - Update task
- `DELETE /api/tasks/:id` - Delete task
- `GET /api/profiles` - List all profiles
- `POST /api/profiles` - Create new profile (automatically creates folder structure)
- `PUT /api/profiles/:id` - Update profile
- `POST /api/profiles/:id/launch` - Launch profile
- `GET /api/profiles/:id/folder` - Get profile folder information
- `DELETE /api/profiles/:id` - Delete profile (removes folder structure)

#### UI Components
- **Dashboard**: Main interface with tabbed navigation
- **Sidebar**: Navigation menu with task and profile counts
- **TaskListPanel**: Task management interface with filtering and actions
- **ProfilesPanel**: Profile management with create/edit capabilities
- **CreateProfileModal**: Form for creating new browser profiles

#### Profile Folder Management System
- **ProfileManager Service**: Handles file system operations for browser profiles
- **Automatic Folder Creation**: Each new profile creates a dedicated folder structure:
  - `server/profiles/{id}/` (numbered folders: 1, 2, 3, etc.)
  - Subdirectories: `chrome-profile/` for persistent browser session data
  - Configuration files: `config.json` with complete browser settings
  - Script file: `script.js` containing puppeteer automation code
- **Profile Configuration**: 
  - Complete browser settings with default user agents
  - Proxy configuration and preferences
  - Viewport dimensions, timezone, and language settings
  - File paths for profile-specific data storage
- **Puppeteer Integration**:
  - Launch button executes script.js as actual puppeteer automation
  - Browser launched with profile-specific configuration
  - Persistent user data directory for session management
  - Full support for headless/visible browser modes
  - Comprehensive error handling and execution logging
- **Lifecycle Management**: Folders created on profile creation, updated on modifications, deleted on profile removal

## Data Flow

1. **Task Management Flow**:
   - External tasks fetched from Task Center API via authenticated requests
   - Tasks stored locally in PostgreSQL database
   - Real-time updates through React Query cache invalidation
   - CRUD operations for local task management

2. **Profile Flow**:
   - Profiles created and managed entirely locally
   - Automatic folder structure creation for each profile
   - Individual profile directories with cookies, cache, downloads, extensions folders
   - Profile configuration files (profile.json, browser_config.json) 
   - Form validation using Zod schemas
   - Profile launching triggers browser automation
   - Status tracking for active/inactive profiles
   - Folder cleanup on profile deletion

3. **State Management**:
   - Server state managed by TanStack Query
   - Optimistic updates for better UX
   - Error handling with toast notifications
   - Automatic cache invalidation on mutations

- July 3, 2025. Completed final "Browser Profiles" to "Profiles" terminology cleanup - updated remaining references in storage interface comments, error messages in profiles panel, and config.json descriptions to use simplified "Profiles" terminology consistently throughout the entire application.
- July 3, 2025. Completed server-side profiles.ts cleanup - updated all remaining "browser profile" references to "profile" in code comments and error messages, ensuring complete terminology consistency across the entire codebase.
- July 3, 2025. **MAJOR CLEANUP COMPLETED** - Completed comprehensive code-level terminology refactoring from "browserProfiles" to "profiles" throughout the entire application: updated shared/schema.ts table exports, storage.ts internal Map variables and method references, frontend component variable names in tasks-panel.tsx and profiles-panel.tsx, ensuring complete consistency between user-facing terminology and internal code structure. All references to "browserProfiles" have been systematically replaced with "profiles" while maintaining full application functionality.
- July 3, 2025. Fixed Profile column text alignment issue in both Task List and Profiles panels - added text-left class to TableCell components to ensure Profile column text is left-aligned instead of center-aligned for better readability and consistency with standard table layouts.
- July 3, 2025. **MAJOR STATUS SYSTEM UPDATE** - Completed comprehensive "inactive" to "READY" terminology conversion throughout entire application: updated all TypeScript files (server/src/routes/profiles.ts, server/src/storage.ts, client/src/components/profiles-panel.tsx, client/src/components/create-profile-modal.tsx), implemented config.json status persistence system with updateProfileStatusInConfig() helper function, updated all existing config.json files (13 total) to include "status": "READY" field, enhanced profiles loading to read status from config files ensuring persistence across application restarts, updated status mapping functions and color schemes to use "READY" instead of "inactive" for better user experience and consistency.
- July 3, 2025. **CRITICAL PROFILE ID MAPPING FIX** - Resolved profile ID mismatch between memory storage and file system folders: modified storage.createProfile() to preserve original folder-based IDs (2, 4, 5, 18, 27) instead of reassigning sequential ones (1, 2, 3...), updated profiles.ts route to pass existing profile IDs when syncing from file system, ensuring Profile Details modal displays correct profile ID matching actual folder structure, eliminated "Profile folder not found" errors during script execution.
- July 3, 2025. **NEW PROFILE CREATION FIX** - Fixed new profile creation workflow: added automatic folder structure creation to POST /api/profiles endpoint using profileManager.createProfileFolder(), enhanced error logging for folder creation debugging, ensured new profiles include proper script.js template and config.json with status field, verified complete profile folder creation (config.json, script.js, chrome-profile subdirectories) for seamless script editing and execution capabilities.
- July 3, 2025. **VNC REMOVAL COMPLETED** - Removed all VNC-related configurations from browser automation system: eliminated VNC display settings, DISPLAY environment variables, and VNC-specific browser launch arguments, updated Chrome to run locally in visible mode (headless: false) instead of relying on VNC for display, simplified browser launch options for better local execution performance, updated logging messages to remove VNC references throughout execution system.
- July 3, 2025. **BROWSER CLOSURE FIX** - Added proper browser closure after script execution in execution.ts: browser now closes automatically after executeUserScript completes (both success and error cases), fixed Chrome executable path to use correct Nix store location for Replit environment, enhanced error handling with proper cleanup in both success and failure scenarios.
- July 3, 2025. **TYPESCRIPT FIXES COMPLETED** - Systematically resolved all remaining TypeScript errors in tasks.ts and vite.ts: fixed taskId undefined references by using req.params.id, corrected ExecutionResult property mapping (removed non-existent startTime/endTime), added proper error type casting with (error as Error), fixed duplicate profileName issues in execution responses, resolved ES module import compatibility issues in vite.ts by updating import statements and removing problematic createLogger references, simplified vite configuration to eliminate TypeScript compilation errors, server now running successfully with clean TypeScript compilation.
